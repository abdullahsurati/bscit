						<img src="introduction.png" style="border:5px solid black;width:100%;height:auto;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></img>
						<br><br><br>
						<h4>Chapter 2: Survey of Technologies</h4>
						<p>In this chapter Survey of Technologies should demonstrate the students awareness and understanding of Available Technologies related to the topic of the project. The student should give the detail of all the related technologies that are necessary to complete the project. The should describe the technologies available in the chosen area and present a comparative study of all those Available Technologies. Explain why the student selected the one technology for the completion of the objectives of the project.</p>
						<br>
						<h4>Chapter 3: Requirements and Analysis</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Problem Definition: Define the problem on which the students are working in the project. Provide details of the overall problem and then divide the problem in to sub-problems. Define each sub-problem clearly.</li>
							<li>Requirements Specification: In this phase the student should define the requirements of the system, independent of how these requirements will be accomplished. The Requirements Specification describes the things in the system and the actions that can be done on these things. Identify the operation and problems of the existing system.</li>
							<li>Planning and Scheduling: Planning and scheduling is a complicated part of software development. Planning, for our purposes, can be thought of as determining all the small tasks that must be carried out in order to accomplish the goal. Planning also takes into account, rules, known as constraints, which, control when certain tasks can or cannot happen. Scheduling can be thought of as determining whether adequate resources are available to carry out the plan. The student should show the Gantt chart and Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT).</li>
							<li>Software and Hardware Requirements: Define the details of all the software and hardware needed for the development and implementation of the project.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Hardware Requirement: In this section, the equipment, graphics card, numeric co-processor, mouse, disk capacity, RAM capacity etc. necessary to run the software must be noted.</li>
								<li>Software Requirements: In this section, the operating system, the compiler, testing tools, linker, and the libraries etc. necessary to compile, link and install the software must be listed.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Preliminary Product Description: Identify the requirements and objectives of the new system. Define the functions and operation of the application/system the students are developing as project.</li>
							<li>Conceptual Models: The student should understand the problem domain and produce a model of the system, which describes operations that can be performed on the system, and the allowable sequences of those operations. Conceptual Models could consist of complete Data Flow Diagrams, ER diagrams, Object-oriented diagrams, System Flowcharts etc.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<h4>Chapter 4: System Design</h4>
						<p>Describes desired features and operations in detail, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, pseudocode and other documentation.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Basic Modules: The students should follow the divide and conquer theory, so divide the overall problem into more manageable parts and develop each part or module separately. When all modules are ready, the student should integrate all the modules into one system. In this phase, the student should briefly describe all the modules and the functionality of these modules.</li>
							<li>Data Design: Data design will consist of how data is organised, managed and manipulated.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Schema Design: Define the structure and explanation of schemas used in the project.</li>
								<li>Data Integrity and Constraints: Define and explain all the validity checks and constraintsprovided to maintain data integrity.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Procedural Design: Procedural design is a systematic way for developing algorithms or procedurals.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Logic Diagrams: Define the systematical flow of procedure that improves its comprehension andhelps the programmer during implementation. e.g., Control Flow Chart, Process Diagrams etc.</li>
								<li>Data Structures: Create and define the data structure used in procedures.</li>
								<li>Algorithms Design: With proper explanations of input data, output data, logic of processes,design and explain the working of algorithms.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>User Interface Design: Define user, task, environment analysis and how to map those requirements in order to develop a “User Interface”. Describe the external and internal components and the architecture of user interface. Show some rough pictorial views of the user interface and its components.</li>
							<li>Security Issues: Discuss Real-time considerations and Security issues related to the project and explain how the student intends avoiding those security problems. What are the security policy plans and architecture?</li>
							<li>Test Cases Design: Define test cases, which will provide easy detection of errors and mistakes with in a minimum period of time and with the least effort. Explain the different conditions in which the students wish to ensure the correct working of the project.</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="systemdesign.png" style="border:5px solid black;width:100%;height:auto;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></img>
						<br><br><br>
						<h4>Chapter 5: Implementation and Testing</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Implementation Approaches: Define the plan of implementation, and the standards the students have used in the implementation.</li>
							<li>Coding Details and Code Efficiency: Students not need include full source code, instead, include only the important codes (algorithms, applets code, forms code etc). The program code should contain comments needed for explaining the work a piece of code does. Comments may be needed to explain why it does it, or, why it does a particular way.The student can explain the function of the code with a shot of the output screen of that program code.</li>
							<li>Code Efficiency: The student should explain how the code is efficient and how the students have handled code optimisation.</li>
							<li>Testing Approach: Testing should be according to the scheme presented in the system design chapter and should follow some suitable model – e.g., category partition, state machine-based. Both functional testing and user-acceptance testing are appropriate. Explain the approach of testing.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Unit Testing: Unit testing deals with testing a unit or module as a whole. This would test the interaction of many functions but, do confine the test within one module.</li>
								<li>Integrated Testing: Brings all the modules together into a special testing environment, then checks for errors, bugs and interoperability. It deals with tests for the entire application. Application limits and features are tested here.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Modifications and Improvements: Once the students finish the testing they are bound to be faced with bugs, errors and they will need to modify your source code to improve the system. Define what modification are implemented in the system and how it improved the system.</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="implementation.png" style="border:5px solid black;width:100%;height:auto;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></img>
						<br><br><br>
						<h4>Chapter 6: Results and Discussion</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Test Reports: Explain the test results and reports based on the test cases, which should show that the project is capable of facing any problematic situation and that it works fine in different conditions. Take the different sample inputs and show the outputs.</li>
							<li>User Documentation: Define the working of the software; explain its different functions, components with screen shots. The user document should provide all the details of the product in such a way that any user reading the manual, is able to understand the working and functionality of the document.</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="results.png" style="border:5px solid black;width:100%;height:auto;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></img>
						<br><br><br>
						<h4>Chapter 7: Conclusions and Future Work</h4>
						<p>The conclusions can be summarised in a fairly short chapter (2 or 3 pages). This chapter brings together many of the points that would have made in the other chapters.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Limitations of the System: Explain the limitations encountered during the testing of the project that the students were not able to modify. List the criticisms accepted during the demonstrations of the project.</li>
							<li>Future Scope of the Project describes two things: firstly, new areas of investigation prompted by developments in this project, and secondly, parts of the current work that was not completed due to time constraints and/or problems encountered.</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="conclusion.png" style="border:5px solid black;width:100%;height:auto;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></img>
						<br><br><br>
						<h4>xii. References</h4>
						<p>It is very important that the students acknowledge the work of others that they have used or adapted in their own work, or that provides the essential background or context to the project. The use of references is the standard way to do this. Please follow the given standard for the references for books, journals, and online material. The citation is mandatory in both the reports.</p>
						<p>Eg.</p>
						<p>Lipson, Charles (2011). Cite right : A quick guide to citation styles; MLA, APA, Chicago, the sciences, professions, and more (2nd ed.). Chicago [u.a.]: University of Chicago Press. p. 187. ISBN 9780226484648.</p>
						<img src="references.png" style="border:5px solid black;width:100%;height:auto;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></img>
						<br><br><br>
						<h4>xiii. Glossary</h4>
						<p>If you the students any acronyms, abbreviations, symbols, or uncommon terms in the project report then their meaning should be explained where they first occur. If they go on to use any of them extensively then it is helpful to list them in this section and define the meaning.</p>
						<br>
						<h4>xiv. Appendices</h4>
						<p>These may be provided to include further details of results, mathematical derivations, certain illustrative parts of the program code (e.g., class interfaces), user documentation etc.</p>
						<p>In particular, if there are technical details of the work done that might be useful to others who wish to build on this work, but that are not sufficiently important to the project as a whole to justify being discussed in the main body of the project, then they should be included as appendices.</p>
						<br><br>
						<h3>Project Viva Voice:</h3>
						<p>Student may be asked to write code for problem during VIVA to demonstrate his coding capabilities and he/she may be asked to write any segment of coding used in the in the project. The project can be done in group of at most four students. However, the length and depth of the project should be justified for the projects done in group. A big project can be modularised and different modules can be assigned as separate project to different students.</p>
						<br>
						<h3>Marks Distribution:</h3>
						<p>Semester 5: Documentation - 50 marks</p>
						<p>Semester 6: Documentation - 50 marks, Implementation and Viva Voce - 100</p>
